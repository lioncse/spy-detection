# spy detection



A spy might be hiding in any given message and we need a way to find them.
A message is formed of an array of integers, and the spyâ€™s code name must appear, in that
order, for the spy to present.

# Example

|Message | Code Name | Spy | Contains spy? |
-------- | --------- | --- | ------------- |
| [1,2,4,0,0,7,5] | [0,0,7] | James Bond | true |
| [0,2,2,0,4,7,0] | [0,0,7] | James Bond | true |
| [1,2,0,7,4,4,0] | [0,0,7] | James Bond | false |
| [3,6,0,1,2,6,4] | [3,1,4] | Ethan Hunt | true |
| [3,3,1,5,1,4,4] | [3,1,4] | Ethan Hunt | true |
| [4,1,3,8,4,3,1] | [3,1,4] | Ethan Hunt | false |
